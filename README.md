## Hi there 👋, I'm Stein Arild

I’m a **Front-End Developer** based in Norway, recently graduated from **Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media**.

I enjoy building clean, user-focused web applications and refining existing projects through better structure, usability, and presentation. I have experience working with both **vanilla JavaScript** and modern frameworks, and I’m comfortable taking a project from initial setup to deployment.

Outside of coding, I enjoy spending time with my family and relaxing with games in the evenings.
